# Emulators
This project is intended to collect all the emulators implemented by myself with the help of google.
I am starting with the GameBoy Color as it was one of my first consoles I ever had and I most played.
For now I have a long journey to embrace.

# Reference to other projects 
I am using the json tests from [raddad772/jsmoo](https://github.com/raddad772/jsmoo/blob/main/misc/tests/GeneratedTests/sm83/README.MD)
I am following this fantastic documented page for the game boy [dbdev(https://gbdev.io/)
